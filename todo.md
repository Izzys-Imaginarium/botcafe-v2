# Task: Fix Splash Page Spacing

## Goal: Center the text elements ("100+ spirits bound", "5k+ tales told", "open to all") vertically in their boxes

## Steps:
- [ ] Examine current splash-hero component implementation
- [ ] Identify the problematic styling causing elements to sit on top of footer
- [ ] Fix vertical centering in the text boxes
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure proper spacing
- [ ] Verify the layout works across different screen sizes

## Notes:
- Elements currently sitting directly on top of footer
- Need better vertical centering within their containers
- Maintain responsive design
